## Digital Classification and Natural Language Processing

### Description

This is a Python-based application that carries out digit classification and natural language processing on the MNIST dataset and a dataset of English-German sentences using the Scikit-Learn library and Tensorflow/Keras
The application also carries out analysis on the results

### Prerequisites

When running this application, Scikit-Learn is needed for the digit classificion, Tensorflow and Keras is needed for the natural language processing section.

### Compiling the code

Compiling the code requires Python and a number of libraries that can be found in the code. Use the following code in the terminal:

```
py DigitClassificationAndNLP.py
```

The training, validation and testing sets are included within the downloaded files.
